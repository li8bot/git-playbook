**Project Description :**


**Objectives :** 


**Mentors :** Abhishek Kumar Annamraju


**Difficulty Level :** High


2. Creating Object Detection workflows across different imaging modalities

**Source Code :**
[Monk Object Detection](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/Monk_Object_Detection)

**Project Description :**
Explore state of the art Object Detection research implementations for :
1) Thermal Imagery
2) Multispectral Satellite Imagery
3) Biomedical Imagery
4) Document Imagery
5) 

and create a high level wrapper using Monk's syntax.

**Objectives :**

- Pull Monk Object Detection repository and test in a local setup
- Go through Documentation and understand the syntax, implementation modules and pipelines.
- Explore state of the art algorithms and applications on different imaging modalities
- Create 10 workflows ( 2 for each imaging modality )
- Build unit tests for setting up Monk locally
