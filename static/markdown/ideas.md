- Integrating Tensorflow 2.0 support for Transfer Learning based Image Classification
	**Source Code :**
	[Monk Image Classification](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/monk_v1)

	**Project Description :**
	Add a low-code wrapper over tensorflow-2.0 as per monk repository's coding standards and backend formats. Goal is to replicate all the modules present in monk's backend (pytorch, keras and mxnet) and create a new one to enable transfer learning and general image classification using tensorflow2.0 backend. 

	**Objectives :** 
	- Pull Monk repository and test in a local setup
	- Run all the examples present in each backend.
	- Go through Documentation and understand the syntax, implementation modules and pipelines.
	- Understand folder and directory sturcture for codes for keras backend.
	- Understand different modes of operation in available backends
	    - quick mode
	    - update mode
	    - expert mode
	    - switch mode
	- Understand how metrics are being saved and used in comparison mode
	- Understand working of hyper-parameter finders 
	- Understand how custom network builder works in different backends.
	- Create wrappers over
	    - pretrained model loaders
	    - data loaders for single label and multi label classification
	    - Neural network layers, activation functions, loss functions, optimizers and learning rate schedulers
	    - data-transformation functions
	- Replicate modes as present in rest of the backends
	    - quick mode
	    - update mode
	    - expert mode
	    - switch mode
	- Create hyper-parameter finder module with tf-2.0 backend
	- Create custom network builder
	- Create examples notebooks

- Creating Object Detection workflows across different imaging modalities
	**Source Code :**
	[Monk Object Detection](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/Monk_Object_Detection)

	**Project Description :**
	Explore state of the art Object Detection research implementations for :
	1) Thermal Imagery
	2) Multispectral Satellite Imagery
	3) Biomedical Imagery
	4) Document Imagery
	5) Face Recognition
	<br/>
	and create a high level wrapper using Monk's syntax.
	<br/>
	**Objectives :**
	- Pull Monk Object Detection repository and test in a local setup
	- Go through Documentation and understand the syntax, implementation modules and pipelines.
	- Explore state of the art algorithms, datasets and applications on different imaging modalities
	- Create 10 workflows ( 2 for each imaging modality )
	- Build unit tests for setting up Monk locally
	- Create blog posts for every workflow
	- Prepare documentation about the implementation
