## Short application checklist:

Read the links and instructions -- All of it! we've tried to give you all the information you need to be an awesome student applicant.

Choose a project (check the [list](https://github.com/li8bot/gsoc2020/blob/master/ideas.md) here). 

Prepare a patch for that project. We expect students to fix a bug and have made a pull request (or equivalent). 

Your code doesn't have to be accepted and merged, but it does have to be visible to the public and it does have to be your own work (mentor help is ok, code you didn't write is not).

Write your application (with help from your mentors!) 

All applications must go through Google's application system; we can't accept any application unless it is submitted there.

- Use a descriptive title and include your project name in Google's system. 
- Make it easy for your mentors to give you feedback using online document collaboration tools.
- Submit your application to Google before the deadline. 

## How should your application look!

An ideal application will contain 5 things:
- A descriptive title including the name of the project you want to work on
- Information about you, including contact information
- Link to a code contribution you have made to the organization
- Information about your proposed plan for the project. This should be fairly detailed and must include a timeline
- Information about other commitments that might affect your ability to work during the GSoC period. (exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc.)
