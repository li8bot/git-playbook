## What is MonkAI

MonkAI is a syntax invariant wrapper on popular Deep Learning frameworks like Pytorch, Keras, Mxnet. The goals are to reduce cognitive loads for novice programmers along with a host of features of value to a domain expert.

## Google Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers post-secondary students an opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.

<b>We're hoping to participate in GSoC 2020! (Google announces their selections on Feb 20, 2020. Stay tuned for updates!)</b>

## How to get started

Being in its early days, MonkAI requires the support of Computer Vision and Deep Learning enthusiasts to guide and participate in the design and development of the library. Currently the following features are available in MonkAI: 

1. [Image Classification using Transfer Learning](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/monk_v1)
2. [Object Detection workflows with a variety of Deep Neural architectures](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/Monk_Object_Detection)
3. [Custom Neural Network designer](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/monk_v1/blob/master/tutorials/8%20-%20Custom%20Model%20Creation%20and%20debugging%20With%20Monk.ipynb)
4. [MonkAI Studio - for a GUI based classification and detection workflows](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/Monk_Gui)

Any open source experience will help you prepare for GSoC, so don't worry too much about what project you try first and don't be afraid to change your mind!

A few steps before you should apply :

- Setup your own development environment and test out the library and tools
- Start communicating with the developers and mentors
- Try to fix any open bugs
- Hunt and report bugs
- Provide help with documentation
- Help others!
